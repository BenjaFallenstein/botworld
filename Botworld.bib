  abstract =     "This book presents sequential decision theory from a
                  novel algorithmic information theory perspective. While the former
                  theory is suited for active agents in known environments, the
                  latter is suited for passive prediction of unknown environments.
                  The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas
                  and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free
                  theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent interacting with
                  an arbitrary unknown world. Most if not all AI problems can easily
                  be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual
                  problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes
                  include sequence prediction, strategic games, function
                  minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. Formal
                  definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem
                  and relations to other approaches to AI are discussed. One
                  intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about
                  abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely
                  to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.",
