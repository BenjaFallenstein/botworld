BotWorld is a cellular automaton designed by [MIRI](intelligence.org) as
a concrete environment in which to study self-modifying agents embedded in
their environment. (Contrast this with "classical" models of artificial
intelligence where agents interact with the environment only via I/O channels.)

An extensive introduction to botworld can be found in the
[Botworld pdf](BotWorld.pdf). The source code for botworld can be found in the
corresponding [literate Haskell file](BotWorld.lhs).
