Botworld is a cellular automaton developed at [MIRI](intelligence.org) as
a concrete environment in which to study self-modifying agents embedded in
their environment. (Contrast this with "classical" models of artificial
intelligence where agents interact with the environment only via I/O channels.)

An extensive introduction to Botworld can be found in the
[Botworld pdf](Botworld.pdf). The source code for Botworld can be found in the
corresponding [literate Haskell file](Botworld.lhs).
